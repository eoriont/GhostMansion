# Ghost Mansion

Ghost Mansion is a minecraft plugin. It is my first attempt at a minigame.

You can download the plugin for your own minecraft server by:
    
* Go to the 'jar' directory in the plugin and download 'GhostMansion.jar'
* If the jar isn't up to date, then clone this git repository and compile it yourself. (Use IntelliJ)
